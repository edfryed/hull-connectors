# Hull ♥ HubSpot

Upgrade [HubSpot](http://hubspot.com) with data from your other tools with Hull

HubSpot lets you publish a website, create landing pages and send messages to your contacts via email and social. You can trigger and track all your messages and interactions back into your contacts profiles, and then use this data to trigger more messages.

#### HubSpot data includes:

- Identities (name, email, company, location…)
- Events (logged in, account created, subscribed…)
- Page views (Viewed “Features” page, Viewed “Demo Request” page…)
- Segments (“Leads”, “New Paying Customers”, “Job Title - CEOs”)


#### With Hull, you can power other tools with your HubSpot data.

Share and sync your contact and event data from HubSpot to do things like:

- Power Salesforce contact records
- Trigger Slack notifications
- Sync HubSpot lists with Mailchimp
- Sync HubSpot lists with Optimizely
- Sync HubSpot lists with Facebook Custom Audiences

#### Upgrade your HubSpot with data from tools and database

You can use all your data from all your tools together to create scores, trigger automation (like HubSpot Workflows) and define personalisation in emails and the website

- Upgrade HubSpot with behavioural data from Mixpanel
- Enrich HubSpot profiles with data from Clearbit
- Trigger HubSpot Workflows with Slack commands and buttons
- Personalise HubSpot websites with data from Salesforce
- Trigger HubSpot workflows with purchase history from Shopify

#### More power and control over your HubSpot data

Hull also gives you more flexibility with your data in HubSpot. Combine multiple sources of data to create advanced segments (without the limits to AND and OR) and user scores using all your data (beyond the simple HubSpot Lead Scoring tool).
